- The PHP session variable `confirmation` is generated with a random value each time `csfr_form.php` is loaded.

- The value of the session variable `confirmation` is sent as a hidden form field value named `confirmation` when the form is submitted.

- This approach ensures that each form submission includes a unique value that can be validated on the server side to mitigate CSRF attacks.
