Difference between strip_tags and htmlentities:

strip_tags:
- This function removes HTML and PHP tags from a string.
- It does not convert special characters to HTML entities.
- It is useful for simply removing HTML tags without converting the content to its HTML entity representation.


htmlentities:
- This function converts all applicable characters to HTML entities.
- It converts characters like "<" to "&lt;", ">" to "&gt;", etc.
- It preserves the original content but escapes special characters, making it safe to display HTML content without executing scripts.
